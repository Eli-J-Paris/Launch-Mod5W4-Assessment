# Week 4 Assessment

In this week's assessment, imagine you have been scheduled for a half-day interview.  The first part of the interview is a technical challenge!  You will have 90 minutes to complete a technical challenge and provide some reflection.

## Technical Challenge (10 points)

### Setup
* Fork and clone this repository.
* Click on 'Planets' in the navbar and make sure you see the 8 planets of our solar system.
* Checkout a new branch and complete the following task.

Your task is to add the explored planets of the galaxy 'Far Far Away'.

We would like you to get the necessary data by consuming the [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/) API.  A successful mission will:
* Use HttpClient to make an API call to SWAPI when a request comes in (to get the most up-to-date information!)
* Display the known planets of the Far Far Away Galaxy on a view

Outside of those requirements, you may choose to add any additional functionality!

When finished, create a PR and include your answers to the reflection questions below in a PR comment.

## Reflection Questions (6 points)
* What about this challenge was most difficult for you?
* Highlight one peice of code that you wrote that you are especially proud of.
* What would you do next, if we gave you another hour?
